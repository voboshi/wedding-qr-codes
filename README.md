# QRs'R'Fun

A Jekyll-based static website that generates individual pages for wedding guests from a CSV file.

## Setup

1. Install Jekyll and dependencies:
```bash
bundle install
```

2. Update the `contents.csv` file with your guest information

3. Build and serve locally:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## CSV Format

The `contents.csv` file should have the following columns:
- NAME: Guest's full name
- CONNECTION: How they're connected to the couple
- INTERESTS: Their interests and talking points
- MEET_OTHERS: Other guests they should meet

## Deployment

This site is configured for GitHub Pages deployment. Simply push to your repository and enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings.

## Prompt used with Claude Code

```
Hi Claude! We will build a static website using Jekyll that will generate completely independent pages based on content coming from a CSV file. Please think through the following and help.

<static_website_generator>

We will use Jekyll as our static site generator.
We will use the "Basically Basic" theme for Jekyll.
The website will not show a menu for navigation.
Each page generated by Jekyll will be standalone, reachable only by its address.
The filename of each generated page will be the NAME that was used to generate it from the CSV file.
We will host the website with GitHub Pages.
We will read the CSV file "contents.csv" to pull in the data needed to create all the pages.

<page_structure>

For each page, we will show multiple headings, and under each heading we will style the content coming in from the CSV file.
The headings and the respective column connections are:
  Who - NAME
  Connection - CONNECTION
  Talking points & interests - INTERESTS
  Should meet - MEET_OTHERS
We should use the Garamond font, and we should have a mobile-friendly layout for each page.

<other>

For any unclear instruction or when there are multiple choices you can make, please ask me to clarify and decide.
